This project was a side job for the Wisconsin Kohler Public Library&rsquo;s website. Seeking to enhance user experience, 
the library had previously collaborated with a third-party company to implement an application for event registrations. 
However, the existing setup lacked a user-friendly pathway to this application beyond a basic hyperlink. To solve this problem, 
the library sought a way to showcase events directly on its website. Consequently, they
hired me to develop an API capable of extracting data from
third-party software and presenting it in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
